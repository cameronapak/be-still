## Things to know

- Created via the Astro-based [Freedom Stack](https://github.com/cameronapak/freedom-stack) boilerplate. Visit that boilerplate for more information on how to use it and how to use this project.
- This project is deployed to Netlify.
- Uses Partykit backend for WebSocket-based communication.
- If you make changes to the Partykit backend, you will need to redeploy it.
